    For this challenge, your goal is to prove your understanding of how buffer overflows work, by logging remotely into a system without
    knowing the password it's asking for.

    You'll be working with a C program called `login.c`, which is the source code for the binary that handles the login process. 
    The code in `login.c` should give you all the info you need, but to make it easier, weâ€™re also providing a copy of the binary
    (with a different password) for reference.
