# CWE-120

A buffer overflow happens when too much data is crammed into a buffer, which is a storage area. When this happens,
the extra data spills over and can mess up nearby memory. This can lead to things like crashes, data corruption,
or even letting hackers take control of the system. That's what CWE-120 is all about.
