For this challenge, your goal is to show you get how buffer overflows work by logging remotely into a system without
knowing the password its asking for.

You’ll be working with a C program called "login.c," which is the source code for the binary that handles the login process. 
The code in "login.c" should give you all the info you need, but to make it easier, we’re also providing a copy of the binary
(with a different password) for reference.
